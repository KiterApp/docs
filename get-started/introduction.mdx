## Steps to Get Started

Before diving into the API, follow these steps to set up and familiarize yourself with the PromptLoop platform:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your goal and create a task">
    Start by clearly defining the objective you want to achieve with AI processing. Then, use PromptLoop's task creation interface to set up a task that aligns with your goal. This could involve selecting from pre-built templates or creating a custom task using our editor.
    You can create a task in your [dashboard]('https://www.promptloop.com/account/custom')
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and edit your task">
    Once your task is created, use the testing interface to run it on sample data. This allows you to verify that the task produces the desired output. If needed, refine your task by adjusting parameters, prompts, or logic to improve accuracy and relevance of results.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run a dataset on your task">
    After you're satisfied with your task's performance on test data, prepare your full dataset for processing. Use the PromptLoop interface to upload your dataset and initiate the processing job. This step is where you'll transition to using the Batch API for larger scale operations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review, filter, search, and export results">
    Once processing is complete, examine the results using PromptLoop's built-in tools. You can filter and search through the output to find specific information. Finally, export the processed data in your preferred format for further use or analysis in other systems.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After completing these steps, you'll be well-prepared to `leverage the full power of the Batch API for your large-scale data processing needs.
